;; It contains general key bindings.

;; This is the last file loaded.

;; The word general here means independent of any package. Since the end user can exclude an arbitrary set of packages, you cannot be sure that, just because your layer includes a package, that package will necessarily be loaded. For this reason, code in these files must be generally safe, regardless of which packages are installed.

;; More on this in the next section.
